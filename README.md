###Best Methods

###First Steps

1. Gather items by group:  books, clothing, knick knacks, and put them on the floor of the livingroom.
2. Sort out the things I want and separate from the things I have emotional attachment to but no need for.
3. Thank each object for serving its purpose.
4. Designate a donation bin, a trash bin, and a keep bin to organize.


###Places I want to focus

* getting rid of the larger items of furniture- the couch and the table
* eliminating some of the extra kitchen supplies
* getting down on books I won't read
* throwing away bathroom stuff- cosmetics, old shampoo bottles
* being able to breathe and feel space in my 425 square foot apartment!
